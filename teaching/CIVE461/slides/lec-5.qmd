## Basis for Choice Modeling {.smaller}
- Aggregate demand models (such as those we have been discussing) based on observations for **groups of travelers** or **average relations** for zones
- **Discrete choice:** probability an individual chooses a given option a function of their socioeconomic characteristics & relative attractiveness of the option
- Cannot estimate via least squares because probability is unobserved – only observe choice
- Models are **probabilistic** & do not give an outcome value such as **trips** – must use probability concepts to generate discrete outcomes (summation over all observations to give expected number choosing option or use sample enumeration to allocate discrete outcomes)

## Basis for Choice Modeling {.smaller}
- Individuals derive **utility** from the use of alternatives defined by a **utility function** often denoted by V
$$Vpeanut butter = 0.25 – 1.0 ALLERGY - 0.5 PRICE + 0.25 ORGANIC$$
- Need probability value between 0 & 1. Various forms, generally with an s-shaped plot. Main ones are
$$𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡:𝑃_1=exp⁡(𝑉_1 )/(exp⁡(𝑉1)+exp⁡(𝑉2))$$
$$𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑡:𝑃_1=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}⁡\int_{-\infty}^{V_1-V_2+x_1}\frac{⁡exp⁡(\frac{−1}{2(1−\rho^2)} (\frac{𝑥_1}{\sigma_1})^2−\frac{2\rho 𝑥_1 𝑥_2}{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}+(\frac{𝑥_2}{\sigma_2})^2}{2\pi\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sqrt{1−\rho^2 }} 𝑑𝑥_2 𝑑𝑥_1$$

## Properties of Discrete Choice (DC)
- Based on theories of **individual behavior** & do not constitute physical analogies – therefore stable over time & space
- Can be more **statistically efficient** than aggregate models because each observation is an outcome rather than using aggregations of potentially hundreds of observations
- DM less likely to suffer from bias due to correlation between aggregate units – i.e., **ecological correlation** (fallacy)

## Ecological Fallacy

## Theoretical Framework {.smaller}
- Individuals belong to a **homogeneous population** $I$, act rationally, & **possess perfect information** – i.e., they always select the option that maximizes their net personal utility subject to legal, social, physical, &/or budgetary (both time & money) constraints
- There is a certain set $𝐴 = \{𝐴_1, …𝐴_𝑗,…𝐴_J\}$ of available alternatives & a set X of vectors of measured attributes of individuals & their alternatives
- An individual $i$ is endowed with a set of attributes $𝑥 \in 𝑋$ & faces a choice set $𝐴(i) \in 𝐴$
- We will assume choice set is predetermined for individuals

## Theoretical Framework
- Modeler, an observer, does not **posses complete information** about all elements considered by the individual making choice
- Modeler assumes $𝑈_{ij}$  can be represented by two components:
  - A **measurable**, **systematic**, or **representative** part $𝑉_{ij}$,  which is a function of the measured attributes $x$
  - A random part $\epsilon_{ij}$,  which reflects **indiosyncratic** & **taste variation**, together with measurement or observational errors made by the modeler

## Theoretical Framework
- Modeler sets utility $𝑈_{ij}}=𝑉_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}}$ to address two apparent irrationalities
  1. That two individuals faced with the **same situation** & having the **same personal attributes** make different choices
  2. That an individual may not select the alternative that **appears** to be the *best one*
- Often assumed $V_{ij}$ given by $\sum_k^K \beta_{jk} x_{ijk}$ here $\beta_{jk}$ are assumed **constant** for all individuals $I$ in the homogeneous set but **may vary across alternatives** $J$

## Theoretical Framework {.smaller}
- Individual chooses an alternative based on $𝑈_{ij}≥ 𝑈_{qj} \forall A_q \in A(i)$
- Or: $𝑉_{ij}  – 𝑉_{iq}≥\epsilon_{iq}  − \epsilon_{ij}$ (notice swapping of 𝒋 & q)

Not possible to know with certainty if the inequality holds, so use 
$$𝑃_{ij}  = 𝑃(\epsilon{ij} \leq \epsilon_{iq} + (V_{ij} - V_{iq})) \forall A_q \in A(i)$$ 
- Do not know distribution of joint residuals, so cannot derive analytical expression for model
- Can denote $f(\epsilon) = f(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, ... \epsilon_J$ & know they are **random variables** with a certain distribution

## Theoretical Framework {.smaller}
- Can note that distribution for $f(U)$ is the same but with mean $V$ rather than 0
$$P_{ij} = \int_{R_J} f(\epsilon) d\epsilon$$
$$\text{where } R_J = \begin{cases}
\epsilon_{iq} \leq \epsilon_{ij} + (V_{ij} - V_{iq}), & \forall A_q \in A(i) \\
V_{ij}) + \epsilon_{ij} \ge 0 \\
\end{cases}$$
- Assuming independent & identically distributed (**IID**) residuals,
$$f(\epsilon_1,...\epsilon_J) = \prod_j^J g(\epsilon_j)$$
- And (drop $i$ for simplicity)
$$P_j = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\epsilon_j) d\epsilon_j \prod_{q \neq j} \int_{-\infty}^{V_j-V_q+\epsilon_j} g(\epsilon_q) d\epsilon_q$$

## Generating the Logit Model {.smaller}
- Assuming IID Gumbel (**Extreme Value Type I**) residuals, or equivalently that residual differences are **logistically distributed**, gives the standard multinomial logit specification
- Termed *softmax function* in machine learning field
$$P_{ij} = \frac{exp(\mu V_{ij})}{\sum_{A_q \in A(i)} exp(\mu V_{iq})}$$
- Where $\mu$ is a **scale parameter** assumed equal to 1.0 for identification

## Logit Model Parameter Estimation
- Commercial (& opensource) software exists to estimate model parameters using the method of maximum likelihood estimation
  - Apollo (R & free)
  - Biogeme (Python & free)
  - STATA (commercial)
  - LIMDEP (commercial)
  - GAUSS (commercial)

- Parameter interpretation similar to regression (t-statistics, GoF, etc.)

## Direct & Cross Elasticity
- **Direct elasticity:** direct effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for the same good
  - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt transit fare, transit travel time, or transit headway
- **Cross elasticity:** effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for a different good
  - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt auto travel time

## Logit -  Direct Elasticity
Direct elasticity of the probability of an individual $i$ choosing alternative $j$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{jk}$ with coefficient $\beta_k$ (ignoring $i$ subscripts for simplicity)

$$e_{direct} = \frac{\partial P_j}{\partial X_{jk}} \frac{X_{jk}}{P_j}=(1-P_j)X_{jk}\beta_k$$


## Logit -  Cross Elasticity {.smaller}
- Cross elasticity of the probability of an individual $i$ choosing alternative $j$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{lk}$ with coefficient $\beta_k$ for a different alternative

$$e_{cross} = -P_jX_{jk}\beta_k$$

- Above is same regardless of alternative $l$. I.e., **all alternatives** $J$ have the same cross-elasticity wrt an attribute $k$ of alternative $j$
- Above results from independence of irrelevant alternatives (**IIA**) property of basic logit model

## Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) Property
Consider we have two modes: auto (a) & bus (b)

$$\frac{P_a}{P_b} = \frac{exp(V_a)}{exp(V_b)} = exp(V_a - V_b)$$
I.e., the relative probability of choosing auto vs. bus depends **only** on the utilities of the two alternatives

- Now what if our buses are **red (rb)** & we paint half **blue (bb)**?

## IIA Cont…
- If the IIA assumption does not hold, we can make other error distribution assumptions
  -   Nested logit (can handle complex decision structures)
  - Probit (normal error terms, very general model, but can be difficult to work with it)
