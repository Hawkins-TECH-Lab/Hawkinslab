## What is a city?{background="#FFFFFF"}
  - A large town
  - A region of high population density
  - *Civitas*: a community of citizens  
  governed by a common set of laws ![](../assets/images/research/plato_bust.jpg){.absolute top="150" right="0"}
  - *Polis*: the administrative center of a city-state

## A Note on Theory of Integration{background="#FFFFFF"}
- Individual decision models (comprising holons) as [complex emergent systems]{style="color:red;"} vs. joint decision models (structural, copula multivariate distributions, etc.) as [microeconomic systems]{style="color:red;"}
- **No absolute answers:** Analogous to the [frequentist]{style="color:red;"} vs. [Bayesian]{style="color:red;"} debates in statistics  ![](../assets/images/research/debate.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" left="300" width=30%}

## Home Production and Location Choice{background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- “Eco-nomics” from Greek: Oikos (“household”) and Nemein (“management”)
- Begin from model of Becker: households make tradeoffs between home production (time allocation) & market consumption (money allocation)
- Forms a consistent theoretical basis for integrating transportation, land use, & macroeconomic models
- Activity-based travel models have similar theoretical lineage (through value of travel time literature of DeSepera, Evans, & Jara-Diaz)
- How much time do I spend on activities in the home vs. out of the home?
- Do I want a large home with plenty of space for cooking or a small apartment close to a variety of restaurants?

## Research Gaps in Home Production {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
**Data Gaps**

- Household travel surveys do not consider in-home activities
- Expensive & challenging to collect survey data with both time use & expenditure responses (we tried it)
- Data fusion methods used in home production literature are ad hoc & poorly developed

**Model Gaps**

- Only considers single-person households
- Does not model non-working household members
- Arbitrary definition of consumption technology: minimum time required to consume a good or service

## Conceptual Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- Assume a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model with a generalized nested logit error structure
- Conceptual model developed for joint location-time use-consumption decisions
$$ F\left(\epsilon_1^*,\left(\epsilon_{12},…\epsilon_{1k} \right),\left(\epsilon_{l2},…\epsilon_{lK} \right),…\left(\epsilon_{L1},…\epsilon_{LK} \right)\right)= \\ \exp \left(-\exp \left(\frac{-\epsilon_1^*}{\sigma}\right)\right)\prod_{l=1}^L\left[\exp -\left(\sum_{k=1}^K \exp  \left(\frac{-\epsilon_{lk}}{\sigma\theta}\right)\right)^\theta \right]$$

## Conceptual Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- Maximize the objective function
$$ max\left(U_q\left(x_{ql},t_{ql},t_{qlw}\right)\right)=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{k=1}^{K}u_k\left(x_{qlk}\right)+\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\widetilde{u}}_n\left(t_{qln}\right)+\sum_{l=1}^{L}{\widetilde{u}}_w\left(t_{qlw}\right)$$
- With the following baseline utility function
$$\psi_{qkl}=exp\left(\beta_q^\prime z_{qlk}+\delta_q^\prime x_{ql}+\epsilon_{qlk}\right)$$
$$\psi_{qnl}=\exp{\left({\widetilde{\beta}}_q^\prime{\widetilde{z}}_{qln}+{\widetilde{\delta}}_q^\prime{\widetilde{x}}_{ql}+{\widetilde{\epsilon}}_{qln}\right)}$$
$$\psi_{qwl}=\exp{\left({\widetilde{\beta}}_q^\prime{\widetilde{z}}_{qlw}+{\widetilde{\delta}}_q^\prime{\widetilde{x}}_{ql}+{\widetilde{\epsilon}}_{qlw}\right)}$$

## Location Choice Models {background="#FFFFFF"}
- I do plenty of these models!
- Residential location choice - bid-auction setup with multi-person utility
- Firm location choice - considering firm structure and choiceset generation
  - Semi-Compensatory Indepedent Availability Logit (SCIAL) with Aggregation of Alternatives

## Empirical Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF"}
- Simplify from general model structure by removing location choice $L$
- Assume a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) utility with a translated CES function (assuming $\alpha_k->0$ gives a variant of the LES function)
$$U\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\gamma_n}{\alpha_n}\psi_n\left[\left(\frac{x_n}{\gamma_n}+1\right)^{\alpha_n}-1\right]$$

## Empirical Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- Maximize the objective function
$$ max\left(U_q\left(\mathbf{x}_q,\mathbf{t}_q,\mathbf{t}_{qw}\right)\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{K}u_k\left(x_{qk}\right)+\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\widetilde{u}}_n\left(t_{nq}\right)+{\widetilde{u}}_w\left(t_{wq}\right)$$
- Subject to the constraints
$$\sum_{k=1}^{K}p_{qk}x_{qk}=E_q+\omega_qt_{qw}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^{N}t_{qn}+t_{qw}=T_q$$

## Empirical Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- Assume all members of a household are subject to a common monetary budget constraint & independent temporal budget constraints
- Introduce a parallel constraint (model called [PC-MDCEV]{style="color:red;"}) through a change in the specification of the GEV error structure to
$$G\left(Y_{11},Y_{12},\ldots Y_{1k}\ldots Y_{H1}\ldots Y_{Hk}\right)=\prod_{h}^{H}\left(\sum_{k}^{K}Y_{hk}\right)^{\theta_h^q}$$
- $𝜃_ℎ^𝑞$ represents the contribution of individual q (household member h) to consumption by household H
- $𝜃_ℎ^𝑞$ can be parameterized based on member characteristics and is identified off inter-household variations

## Empirical Model Framework {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- With some simplication, the joint likelihood function for individual $q$ is given by
$$\begin{matrix}P_q=\left[c_{qw}\prod_{k=2}^{K}c_{qk}\sum_{k=1}^{M}\frac{1}{c_{qk}}\prod_{n=2}^{\widetilde{M}}c_{qn}\sum_{n=1}^{\widetilde{M}}\frac{1}{c_{qn}}\right]\left[\frac{{\widetilde{V}}_{qw}}{a-b} \exp \left({\widetilde{\beta}\prime}_{qw}{\widetilde{z}}_{qw}\right) \exp \left(-\frac{{\widetilde{V}}_{qw}}{a-b}\exp \left({\widetilde{\beta}\prime}_{qw}{\widetilde{z}}_{qw}\right)\right)\right]\\\prod_{k=1}^{M}\frac{exp\left({\theta_h^qW}_{qk}\right)}{\left(\sum_{k=1}^{K}exp\left({\theta_h^qW}_{qk}\right)\right)}\left(M-1\right)!\left[\frac{\prod_{\widetilde{M}=1}^{\widetilde{M}}\exp\left(W_{qn}\right)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}\exp\left(W_{qn}\right)}\left(\widetilde{M}-1\right)!\right]\\\end{matrix}$$

where
$$a=\frac{\omega_q}{x_{q1}^*}$$
$$b=\frac{1}{t_{q1}^*}$$

## Standard Definition of Minimum Time {background="#FFFFFF"}
- **Conceptually:** minimum time to consume a given good or service
- Leisure activities defined as those to which a person devotes > minimum time (constraint is non-binding)
- Challenging to determine the minimum time and define leisure vs. maintenance activities: based on if the time constraint is binding?
- Jara-Diaz pioneered applications in transportation field
  - Applied work uses an assumption about leisure activities or minimum reported time in dataset

## Standard Definition of Minimum Time {background="#FFFFFF"}
**Problems:**

- How do we define a uniform set of leisure activities? Walking? Watching TV? What about if I think about a research project while riding my bike?
- Travel time has a negative marginal utility & does not fit with positive marginal utility assumption of MDCEV

## Proposed Definition of Minimum Time {background="#FFFFFF"}
**My approach:**

- Travel time removed from total travel budget
- Time budget then becomes [endogenous]{style="color:red;"} as a function of the travel time necessary to move between activity locations (transportation model connection)
- Similarly, monetary budget could be considered [conditional upon the home purchase]{style="color:red;"} (a daily vs. long-term expenditure connection)

## Some Empirical Results {background="#FFFFFF" .smaller}
- Members of [larger households]{style="color:red;"} tend to [spend less time on home production]{style="color:red;"}
  - Represents an opportunity to apply the economics of the firm to an interpretation of household behavior!
  - Larger households, like larger firms, benefit from [economies of scale]{style="color:red;"}
- [Type & mix of dwellings]{style="color:red;"} (detached, townhouse, apartment, etc.) have significant influences on both time use and expenditure
- Both in-home and out-of-home food consumption time tends to increase with age – younger individuals are in a rush to finish their meals?

## Next Steps {background="#FFFFFF"}
- Difficult to jointly model long-term location & medium-term transportation choice for variety of reasons 
<!--(ask past Eric Pas winner Jonas Eliasson)
-->
- Conceptually, model structure is feasible....
- However, how to determine counterfactual activity patterns given a different home location?

## Next Steps
- Machine Learning (Flexibility) + Econometrics (Interpretation)
