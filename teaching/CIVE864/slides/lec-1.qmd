## **Course FAQ** {.smaller}
::: incremental

-   **What background is assumed for the course?** Intermediate statistics and probability

- **Will be doing computing?** Yes. We will use Python and R.

- **Will we learn the mathematical and economic theory of demand?** Yes. This course takes an advanced graduate treatment to the content. Much is covered and much is expected of you.

- **Are these methods applicable to other problems?** Yes. Demand analysis methods are applied in consumer choice, environmental valuation, location choice, and traffic safety fields.
