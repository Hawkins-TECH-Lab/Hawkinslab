    "title": "EV Adoption in the US Midwest",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nTransportation is the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions source in the United States (28%). As such, reducing emissions from this sector is an important step towards addressing climate change impacts. One strategy to address this impact is the electrification of personal vehicles. In this study, we focus on electric vehicle (EV) adoption factors. Past studies on this topic have framed the vehicle adoption question around small vehicles. However, most Americans (60-70%) drive larger vehicles (i.e., SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks). Our goal in this study was to understand how attitudes about EV adoption vary across the population.\nThe core of the research study was a consumer survey administered to residents of Midwest states (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThe survey was administered in Qualtrics and distributed to 2,000 respondents in March, 2023 via an online panel company. Responses were screened for completion time and various other quality checks. After further post-completion quality controls, 1,954 complete responses were used in analysis. Respondent locations are shown below in an interactive map. Each respondent completed six stated preference experiments about their vehicle choice preferences. The available responses were “small car - gas”, “small car - electric”, “large car - gas”, “large car - electric”, “pickup truck - gas”, and “pickup truck - electric” where gas is an internal combustion engine vehicle and electric is a plugin electric vehicle. Additional details on the stated preference experiment are provided below.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nStated preference experiments are a standard approach in consumer analysis to examine the preference for discrete options, where one or more options may not be presently available. Our the case of vehicle ownership, electric pickup trucks have only recently entered the market. We first presented respondents with the following images to illustrate our vehicle class definitions, attempting to keep images generic and free of brand logos that might influence preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then presented respondents with a series of stated preference experiments. These experiments take the form of attribute tables. Respondents must select one option from among the six presented to them. Each option is described by its purchase price, fuel cost (per 100 miles), annual maintenance cost, tax rebeate, recharging time (at a station and at home), driving range (in miles), towing capacity (in lbs), and onboard generator capacity (in days of typical home demand). Most attributes were based on previous survey experiments. However, towing capacity and onboard generator capacity were added to the experiment as features relevant to pickup truck owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Findings\nThe survey provided a wealth of results to be explored by the research team. We present a few of these findings below, with additional analysis provided in forthcoming publications.\nFirst, looking at respondents’ expected next vehicle purchase there is an intuitive trend towards more large vehicles among larger households. Pickup truck preference appears to be relatively constant across household sizes.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nOne of the dimensions that was identified by the research team as missing in prior studies is driving frequency off public roads. It is widely known in the transportation planning community that active mode (walking and cycling) trips are underreported in traditional data sources (e.g., the National Household Travel Survey in the U.S.). When asked about daily trips, survey respondents frequently do not report recreational active mode trips, such as walking the dog around the block. We had the hypothesis that a similar under-reporting may occur among rural residents who use their personal vehicles on their property. This travel may be important for these residents when considering an EV, as it will deplete the vehicle battery (and therefore driving range). For example, a rancher may drive their pickup truck on their property to check on cows and then drive into town. Prior surveys likely missed this travel, resulting in an under-reporting of rural travel. The question was worded as follows: How often do you use your vehicle off public roads for work purposes (e.g., on your property or private roads)? after an initial screening question for whether the respondent makes such trips.\nAs expected, we found that those working in the farming, fishing, and foresty sectors are the most likely to travel off public roads for work. Further, they are the most likely to make such trips at least once per week. We also found a high rates for government and construction workers. Government workers may be driving in parks or to perform inspections on farms or industrial sites. Management and professional works also report making off-road trips. These trips may include engineers and other professional employees visiting farm, forestry, and industrial work sites. However, our main finding is significant travel that we do not believe is reported on conventional travel surveys (e.g., the NHTS).\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nA second cross-tabulation with off-road driving frequency explored was next vehicle type. There interest in this case is whether pickup truck owners are more likely to make such trips. We find evidence for this hypothesis, but it is not as strong as we anticipated, with many car owners reporting that they make trips off public roads 1-3 times per month.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe also asked about the timing for the next vehicle purchase. The below figure summarizes these results by vehicle powertrain choice. We find that many people in the Midwest anticipate their next vehicle will have an internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain - i.e., be either gasoline or diesel. However, those who plan to purchase their next vehicle in greater than 4 years are more likely to buy a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Battery electric vehicle (BEV) purchase intention may grow to 20% but generally hovers around the current national average sales rate of 10%. This result indicates that current intention does not align with climate mitigation scenarios requiring widescale BEV adoption across the country.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAnother factor explored in the survey was access to parking at home. Parking access is a commonly cited barrier to EV adoption in prior research. We find that a large portion of the Midwest population (44.3%) have access to a private enclosed garage. There is a mix of other levels of access to potential home charging facilities. However, 17% of the population lacks a dedicated parking space and a further 12% rely on shared parking that could not accomodate EV charging equipment.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe following two figures are a special kind of diagram called a Sankey plot. Sankey plots are a great way to show shifts between two scenarios. The first Sankey plot shows current vehicle ownership (on the left) and stated vehicle choice in our stated preference experiment. The user can move the boxes around and use the slider below the plot to change the minimum flow (current -&gt; stated choice) to appear in the plot. We can see that most current small vehicle owners also pick this option in our experiment. Few current pickup truck owners pick BEV options in the stated preference experiment. We see the largest shift towards BEV options among current small car owners.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe second Sankey plot shows the relationship between current vehicle ownership and the expected next vehicle purchase. Interestingly, here we see a smaller share of people selecting BEV options than in our experiments. The largest shifts are between vehicle sizes for ICE powertrain vehicles.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nOur initial results suggest that rural travel may be under-reported in conventional statistics due to travel on personal property and private roads for work purposes. This under-reporting will affect the viability of EV adoption in these areas because residents will face driving range factors not properly incorporated into existing analyses. We designed a novel stated preference experiment focused on electric pickup truck adoption. Our initial analysis indicates that electrification in this vehicle market will be slower than among small car owners.\nFurther work will involve more advanced modeling methods and scenario analysis. These results will be published to the website in August 2023.\nWe welcome feedback and suggestions for further analysis using our survey. We provide the complete survey as a pdf below.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of Python and Jupyter notebooks instead of using the VS codespace?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of Python for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the Python packages we’re using in the course. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the VS codespace we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install Python 3.9\nDownload and install an IDE, such as Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, etc.\nInstall any necessary packages with conda install or pip install depending on your setup\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new theories, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Some of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during lecture. You are expected to attend all lecture sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussions. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. More information on loaner laptops can be found here and here."

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, an exam, a project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice applying the transportation planning concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59 pm CT, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59 pm CT.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete non-coding assignments. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a transportation planning experience. The transportation planning experience is an opportunity to engage with transportation planning and analysis outside of the classroom through podcasts, news stories, books, seminars, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one final exam. Through this exam you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course. The exam will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content and it may also include small analysis tasks. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to a real-world dataset. The project will be completed with your teams, and each team will present their work in writing via deliverables due throughout the semester. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TA and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TA, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and contribute to the team project.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point."

I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, there are many resources available on-campus (e.g. CAPS). - I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities.

    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nAcademic honesty policy\nAcademic integrity is of the utmost importance at Nebraska. Be sure you understand expectations of you and your academic work. View the complete list of academic dishonesty violations in the Student Code of Conduct, specifically Article III: Proscribed Conduct, Section B. Conduct – Rules and Regulations, 1. Acts of Academic Dishonesty. For more information, please visit https://studentconduct.unl.edu/. If you are unsure what counts as academic dishonesty in this course, please visit me during office hours. The first instance of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero for the assignment or exam. The second incidence of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.\n\n\nAccommodations for students with disabilities policy\nIt is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students. Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with the Accessibility Services Center and make their requests sufficiently in advance. For more information, contact: Lincoln campus: [Services for Students with Disabilities] (https://www.unl.edu/ssd/) Omaha campus: [Accessibility Services Center] (https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/inclusion/disability-services/students/index.php)\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the [course website] (https://unl-hawkins-lab.github.io/Hawkinslab/teaching/CIVE461/CIVE461.html).\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas - make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course forum Canvas Discussions. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “CIVE 461” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to CIVE 461 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistant.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for homework.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Jason Hawkins and our TA Omid Armantalab before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted by Canvas within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project deadline.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day. If you miss a lecture, make sure to communicate with your project team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nCell phone use and professional behavior\nWhen you come to class, your cell phone must be turned off or silenced and put away where it is not a distraction to you or anyone else. The instructor’s expectations for classroom behavior are based on the norms of the engineering profession. Questions and discussion related to class material are welcome and encouraged but respect for the instructor and fellow classmates is required at all times. No cell phone usage will be allowed during any exams."

Tutorials are provided in the VS codespace on how to conduct these tasks. Additional documentation is available on the Pandas webpage.\nThe course instructor and TA are available to answer coding and modeling questions. Please make maximal use of office hours.\nThis is a group project, so you should make use of your team members. Some students may be stronger in coding, while others may have a firmer grasp of the statistics. You are encouraged to make use of these skills and learn from one another.\nYou may want to split into sub-teams to estimate models, then come together to compare your results.

The model must be a household-based model, in which the dependent variable is the total number of daily non-work trips generated by a given household, and the independent variables are relevant household characteristics. In each case, some experimentation will likely be required to find the “best” model that can be obtained given the available data and the model type chosen. Present and discuss the results of your analysis in terms of the statistical significance of the parameter estimates, the goodness-of-fit of the model, and the rationale for the variables selected for inclusion in the model.\nSimilarly develop a household-based model of daily work trip generation. Compare your results with those obtained for the household-based non-work trip model with respect to explanatory variables used, parameter statistical significance, and model goodness-of-fit. Discuss likely reasons for these differences.\nDevelop a cross-classification model of work trip generation using household size (i.e, number of persons in the household) and number of vehicles as the explanatory variables. Justify your selection of category definitions for each explanatory variable. Discuss your results in terms of their implications for how non-work trip generation varies with household size and number of autos, as well as in terms of the reliability of your results given the obtained cell frequencies. Also compare this model with the regression model developed in question 2. Which would you prefer to use for forecasting and why?"

It should summarize your work this semester in reports 1, 2, and 3. Further the final report should incorporate elements from other topics (e.g., land use and transit planning, equity, etc.) covered this semester.\n\nIntroduction\nThis section includes an introduction to the team’s CBSA, such as population, travel mode share, and other relevant details. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model, including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n\nResults\nIn this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics.\nThis section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Canvas.\nThe report, including visualizations, should be no more than 15 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis in the report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final report. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 15-page limit."

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final models; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your study area from statistical analysis and literature review. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 15 pages.\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks. The Jupyter notebooks should be neatly organized and interpretable to a knowledgeable reader."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions.

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Canvas.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 15 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final report. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 15-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
