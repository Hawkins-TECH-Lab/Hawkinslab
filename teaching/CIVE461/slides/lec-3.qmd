## Institutional Framework & Transportation Planning
::: incremental
- Multiple actors/organizations = complicated decision-making
- Effects of institutional frameworks:
  - Organizational structure influences planning & decision-making process
  - Effective for long-established strategies
  - Challenging for new proposals / innovations

## Strategies (for Planers) to Overcome Institutional Barriers
::: incremental
1. Inclusive set of partners
2. Expand opportunity for public involvement
3. Clear identification of project financing
4. Advocate strengths of quantitative analysis: evidenced-based planning
5. Increase focus on system performance optimization
6. Formal power-sharing among transportation agencies

# Decision-Making Models

## Theoretical Models
1. Rational actor
2. Satisficing
3. Incremental
4. Organizational process
5. Political bargaining

## Rational Actor Model
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Rational, objective decision-making intended to maximize explicit set of goals & objectives
- Completely informed decisions
- Reflected in planning process that evolved in 1950s/60s
- Still used for most major transportation analysis efforts

  & Objectives"]:::C1-->B[Identify Problems]:::C1

## Problems with Rational Actor Model
Normative model of what decision-making should be rather than how it actually is done

::: incremental
- Whose goals/objectives?
- Who defines problems?
- Can all relevant alternatives be examined?
- Can all relevant information by obtained and used?
- How to handle uncertainty?
- Ignores political pressures & non-technical actors
- Emphasizes the “one best way” to solve problems
:::

## Satisficing Model {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Retains *rational actors* but loosens assumption that *solution space* can by exhaustively explored and optimal solution found
- Iterative search for sufficiently good solution

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
- Also known as *Science of Muddling Through*
- Premise it that people:
  - Never can agree on explicit goals & objectives
  - Cannot deal with large alternative set
  - Are problem-simplifiers
  - Focus on policies tat differ incrementally from existing ones
  - Continually redefine problems & solutions

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
- Shifts emphasis from determining goals & objectives to dealing directly with issues & solutions
- Dynamic & on-going process
- Extension of satisficing approach – recognizes limitations in information & assessment capacity
- Addresses alternative generation issue – where do alternatives originate?
  - Typically, recycling old ideas

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](../images/lecture2/incremental_model.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
::: {.column width="25%"}
Problems:

- Reactive -> miss opportunities
- Myopic
- May increment *to death*
- Non-incremental decisions become hard to make
