## Institutional Framework & Transportation Planning
::: incremental
- Multiple actors/organizations = complicated decision-making
- Effects of institutional frameworks:
  - Organizational structure influences planning & decision-making process
  - Effective for long-established strategies
  - Challenging for new proposals / innovations

## Strategies (for Planers) to Overcome Institutional Barriers
::: incremental
1. Inclusive set of partners
2. Expand opportunity for public involvement
3. Clear identification of project financing
4. Advocate strengths of quantitative analysis: evidenced-based planning
5. Increase focus on system performance optimization
6. Formal power-sharing among transportation agencies

# Decision-Making Models

## Theoretical Models
1. Rational actor
2. Satisficing
3. Incremental
4. Organizational process
5. Political bargaining

## Rational Actor Model
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Rational, objective decision-making intended to maximize explicit set of goals & objectives
- Completely informed decisions
- Reflected in planning process that evolved in 1950s/60s
- Still used for most major transportation analysis efforts

  classDef C1 fill:#C0C0C0,stroke:#000000
```
:::

## Problems with Rational Actor Model
Normative model of what decision-making should be rather than how it actually is done

::: incremental
- Whose goals/objectives?
- Who defines problems?
- Can all relevant alternatives be examined?
- Can all relevant information by obtained and used?
- How to handle uncertainty?
- Ignores political pressures & non-technical actors
- Emphasizes the “one best way” to solve problems
:::

## Satisficing Model {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- Retains *rational actors* but loosens assumption that *solution space* can by exhaustively explored and optimal solution found
- Iterative search for sufficiently good solution

:::

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
- Also known as *Science of Muddling Through*
- Premise it that people:
  - Never can agree on explicit goals & objectives
  - Cannot deal with large alternative set
  - Are problem-simplifiers
  - Focus on policies tat differ incrementally from existing ones
  - Continually redefine problems & solutions

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
- Shifts emphasis from determining goals & objectives to dealing directly with issues & solutions
- Dynamic & on-going process
- Extension of satisficing approach – recognizes limitations in information & assessment capacity
- Addresses alternative generation issue – where do alternatives originate?
  - Typically, recycling old ideas

## Incremental Decision-Making Model {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](../images/lecture2/incremental_model.png){fig-align="center"  width=60%}
:::
::: {.column width="25%"}
**Problems:**

- Reactive -> miss opportunities
- Myopic
- May increment *to death*
- Non-incremental decisions become hard to make
:::
:::

## Organizational Process Model {.smaller}
- Most decisions made within organizations (DOT, city, etc.)
- Decisions are influenced by:
  - Formal & informal organizational structures
  - Channels of communication
  - Standard operating procedure
  - Organization’s mandate
  - Politics of bureaucracy
    - Divisions & limitations of power
    - Communications & coordination “overhead” 
    - Protection of “turf”

## Political Bargaining Model {.smaller}
- We live in a pluralistic society
  - Diverse goals
  - Conflicts among competing groups
  - Bargaining required to achieve compromise
- Decision-making inherently political
  - Outcomes seldom optimal
  - Solutions acceptable
  - Controversial aspects often ignored or deferred
- Process tied to election cycles, political agendas, opinion polls, etc.

# Planning and Decision process

## Decision-Making Elements {.smaller}
::: incremental
- **Pluralistic** – conflicting values & fragmented decision-making
- **Resource-allocative** – limited resources lead to necessary tradeoffs
- **Consensus-seeking** – education, citizen involvement, mobilizing business leadership
- **Problem simplifying** – urban systems are complex
- **Uncertainty-avoiding** – dramatic changes in policy, untried solutions, & long-term solutions are rare
:::

## Role of Planning {.smaller}
- Planning informs decision-making process
- Provide information needed/wanted by decision-makers:
  - Available alternatives
  - Tradeoffs
  - Consequences
- Provided information must be:
  - Credible
  - Understandable
  - Timely

## Decision-Making Stages
Planning relates to four major stages of decision-making:

1. Problem identification & definition
2. Debate & choice
3. Implementation
4. Evaluation & feedback

## Monitoring {.smaller}
- Monitoring approach enables a **continuous planning process**
- Contrast with conventional approach of spending **considerable resources** over a period of one or two years to undertake a large-scale transport study
  - Burst of activity may be followed by a much longer period of limited effort in planning and updating plans
  - Reports and master plans become **obsolete or simply forgotten**, and nobody capable of running the models again is left in the planning unit
- New data sources allow us to better **monitor** and **respond** to system state

## Transportation Planning Paradigms

**Conventional**

- Foster convergence in solutions
- Focus on short-term impacts
- Pay attention to physical–material capital. 
- Competition, consumerism, and individualism 
- Faith that technology will provide solutions
- Analyses based on reductionism and assumptions of linearity 

## Transportation Planning Paradigms
**Emerging**

- Diverse & creative solutions
- Focus on long-term payoffs
- Social capital more important than physical capital
- Emphasis on cooperation, quality of life, and community
- Ecology over technology
- Analyses based on emergence and complexity

## Evaluation: Values/Visions, Goals, & Objectives {.smaller}
- Before we can  meaningfully evaluate alternative policies, we must define our values and why we have them
- **Values/Visions:** Basic social drivers that govern human behavior
- **Goals:** Generalized statements that broadly relate physical environment to values – no clear quantification
- **Objectives:** Specific & measurable statements related to attainment of goals
- **Measures of Effectiveness:** Measure of degree of attainment of particular objectives
