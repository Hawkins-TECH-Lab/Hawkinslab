        "We were interested in how user patterns might vary between Omaha and Lincoln. Omaha is a larger city (metro population of about one million people), whereas Lincoln is about a quarter of the size and a college town. To compare users, we first filtered out admin and other invalid trips. Most of the available data pertains to time, so we made maximum use of the timestamps. We considered if a person made a trip in the winter (defined as December, January, February, and March) as a measure of their being an all-season cyclist. We also considered if they biked at night. Nightfall is a bit of a tricky variable. Fortunately, the Python `suntime` package can give us the sunrise and sunset time on any day, adjusting for latitude and daylight saving time. We consider whether a trip is one-way, meaning it returns to the same station at which it started its trip. This variable provides an indication of if the trip was utilitarian or recreational. Finally, we consider the trip count and average duration of trips by user.\n",

        "## Perform Siloutte Analysis To Define K Value for K-Means Clustering\n",
        "We use the k-means clustering to define user groups. This algorithm clusters observations (in our case users) in order to maximize the cross-cluster variation in the input *features*. Our *features* are defined by the variables described above. We use siloutte analysis to find the optimal number of clusters. The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an observation is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. Our results suggest the that four clusters are ideal here.\n"
